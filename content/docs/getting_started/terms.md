# Terms and Definitions

This document provides a standardized lexicon for the **Data for Canada (D4C)** project, categorized by data package and infrastructure component.

<!--
## 1. Foundation Data Package

Terms related to base-layer datasets and structural identifiers.

* **[DGUID (Dissemination Geography Unique Identifier)](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/az/Definition-eng.cfm?ID=geo055):** An alphanumeric code used by Statistics Canada to uniquely identify a geographic area. It incorporates the vintage (year), type, and specific area code.
* **[Building Footprint](https://www.dataforcanada.org/docs/d4c-pkgs/d4c-datapkg-foundation/):** The two-dimensional boundary of a building’s ground-level perimeter, primarily sourced from the Open Database of Buildings (ODB).
* **[Cloud-Native Geospatial](https://www.dataforcanada.org/docs/getting_started/):** Data formats (e.g., Parquet, GeoZarr) optimized for cloud storage and efficient partial-file reading over HTTP.
-->

## 1. Statistical Data Package

Standard geographic areas from the 2021 Census of Population hierarchy, as defined by Statistics Canada.

{{< callout type="important" >}}
  These concepts are key to working with Statistical and Census data from Statistics Canada.

* **[DGUID (Dissemination Geography Unique Identifier)](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/az/Definition-eng.cfm?ID=geo055):** An alphanumeric code used by Statistics Canada to uniquely identify a geographic area. It incorporates the vintage (year), type, and specific area code.

<!-- TODO: Add images for each of these concepts, ideally using https://imfing.github.io/hextra/docs/guide/shortcodes/cards/>

<!-- Use pics from the illustrated glossary, but definitions from the 2021 Census of Population-->

<!-- TODO: Geographic regions of Canada (GRC). StatCan does not technically provide boundaries, had to create them myself. Add definition, maybe a link to where people can send their feedback on not having official GRC boundaries-->

### Statistical Areas

* **[Aggregate Dissemination Area (ADA)](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/92-195-x/2021001/geo/ada/ada-eng.htm):** A dissemination geography created by grouping existing dissemination areas, census subdivisions, or census tracts to achieve a target population.

* **[Census Tract (CT)](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/az/Definition-eng.cfm?ID=geo013):** Small, relatively stable geographic areas within CMAs and CAs that usually have a population between 2,500 and 8,000.
* **[Dissemination Area (DA)](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/az/Definition-eng.cfm?ID=geo021):** A small, stable geographic unit composed of one or more adjacent dissemination blocks.
* **[Dissemination Block (DB)](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/az/Definition-eng.cfm?ID=geo022):** An area bounded on all sides by roads and/or boundaries of standard geographic areas; the smallest unit of census geography.
* **[Economic Region (ER)](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/az/Definition-eng.cfm%3FID%3Dgeo023):** A grouping of complete census divisions created as a standard geographic unit for analysis of regional economic activity.
