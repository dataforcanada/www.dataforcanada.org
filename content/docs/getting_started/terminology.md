<!-- You know what really grinds my gears? The changing of terminology across space and time. For example, dissemination blocks used to be called blocks-->

## Terms and Definitions

This document provides a standardized lexicon for the **Data for Canada (D4C)** project, categorized by data package and infrastructure component.

<!--
## 1. Foundation Data Package

Terms related to base-layer datasets and structural identifiers.

* **[DGUID (Dissemination Geography Unique Identifier)](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/az/Definition-eng.cfm?ID=geo055):** An alphanumeric code used by Statistics Canada to uniquely identify a geographic area. It incorporates the vintage (year), type, and specific area code.
* **[Building Footprint](https://www.dataforcanada.org/docs/d4c-pkgs/d4c-datapkg-foundation/):** The two-dimensional boundary of a building’s ground-level perimeter, primarily sourced from the Open Database of Buildings (ODB).
* **[Cloud-Native Geospatial](https://www.dataforcanada.org/docs/getting_started/):** Data formats (e.g., Parquet, GeoZarr) optimized for cloud storage and efficient partial-file reading over HTTP.

All areas outside population centres are classified as rural areas. Taken together, population centres and rural areas cover all of Canada.
Population centres are classified into three groups, depending on the size of their population:
  * small population centres, with a population between 1,000 and 29,999
  * medium population centres, with a population between 30,000 and 99,999
  * large urban population centres, with a population of 100,000 or more.

A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000 based on data from the current Census of Population Program, of which 50,000 or more must live in the core based on adjusted data from the previous Census of Population Program. To be included in the CMA or CA, other adjacent municipalities must have a high degree of integration with the core, as measured by commuting flows derived from data on place of work from the previous Census Program.

* **[Aggregate Dissemination Area (ADA)](https://s3.labs.dataforcanada.org/backblaze-public/d4u-datapkg-web-corpus/archive/1777399988.113599/singlefile.html):** An aggregate dissemination area (ADA) is a dissemination geography created for the Census. ADAs cover the entire country and, where possible, have a population between 5,000 and 15,000 based on the previous census population counts. ADAs are created by grouping existing dissemination geographic areas, including census tracts (CTs), census subdivisions (CSDs) or dissemination areas (DAs). ADA boundaries respect provincial, territorial, census division (CD), census metropolitan area (CMA) and census agglomeration (CA) boundaries.
* **[Dissemination Area (DA)](https://s3.labs.dataforcanada.org/backblaze-public/d4u-datapkg-web-corpus/archive/1777400015.923444/singlefile.html):** A dissemination area (DA) is a small, relatively stable geographic unit composed of one or more adjacent dissemination blocks with an average population of 400 to 700 persons based on data from the previous Census of Population Program. It is the smallest standard geographic area for which all census data are disseminated. DAs cover all the territory of Canada.

The dissemination block is the smallest geographic area for which population and dwelling counts are disseminated. Dissemination blocks cover all the territory of Canada.

* **[Blockface](https://s3.labs.dataforcanada.org/backblaze-public/d4u-datapkg-web-corpus/archive/1777400245.709323/singlefile.html):** A blockface represents one side of a street between two consecutive features intersecting that street. The features can be other streets or boundaries of standard geographic areas. Blockfaces are used for generating blockface representative points, which in turn are used for geocoding and census data extraction when the street and address information are available.
